 <div class="col"><img src="wildccats.jpg" alt="CatvsWild"></div>
 <p >The domestic cat's journey to becoming a pet began thousands of years ago, with the domestication process being a mutual arrangement between humans and these wildcats. As early farming communities stored grain, they attracted rodents, and the domestic cats became a means of rodent control. Over time, these cats adapted to human life, becoming more social and less aggressive, which led to their domestication.</p>
