  <h2>Why you should donate to cats!</h2>
<p>Providing food and nutrition: Shelters rely on donations to cover the cost of food for dozens or even hundreds of animals daily. This ensures that they receive nutritious meals, supporting their health and well-being while they await adoption. 
Medical care and veterinary services: Many shelter animals arrive with untreated medical conditions, infections, or injuries. Donations help cover essential veterinary services, including vaccinations, spaying and neutering, surgeries, and emergency treatments. 
Comfortable and safe living conditions: Donations go towards cleaning supplies, bedding, climate control, and proper enclosures that create a safe and comfortable temporary home for these pets. 
Supporting spay and neuter programs: Donations help fund spay and neuter programs, which are crucial for reducing the number of unwanted cats and the associated costs. 
Creating safe spaces for homeless cats: Donations support the creation of safe spaces for homeless cats, providing them with a home and a chance to live out their lives in a loving environment.
