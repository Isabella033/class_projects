<p>Low Maintenance:Cats are generally low-maintenance pets. They groom themselves, use litter boxes instinctively, and do not require daily walks like dogs. This makes them ideal for busy individuals or those living in small spaces</p>

<p>Health Benefits:Spending time with cats can have positive effects on mental health. Studies show that petting a cat can lower blood pressure and reduce stress levels. Their presence can provide comfort and emotional support, making them great companions for those dealing with anxiety or depression.
